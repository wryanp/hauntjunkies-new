					WE ARE THE HAUNT JUNKIES!
				</h2>

				<p>
					Extremely passionate and die-hard fans of all things horror - movies, books, video games, you name it - but especially haunted attractions! We travel all over the country visiting and reviewing haunted attractions and we also do one of our own.
				</p>

				<p>
					Started by Megan Johnson and Vilonte McCloud, Haunt Junkies is more than just a home haunt and haunt review team... it's a LIFESTYLE! We're based outside of Atlanta, GA, but (as of 2021) have visited over 100 haunted attractions across 16 states, and we're just getting started! We pride ourselves in giving honest reviews, and we don't have any kind of weird ranking system. We try to keep our reviews interesting, conversational, and to the point versus making you feel like you're reading an editorial or dissertation... boringgggg!
				</p>

				<p>
					Every haunt is unique and offers its own special scares, so we reset our perceptions and expectations each time when rating them. We don't care about the size or amount of money spent, at the end of the day, all that matters to us is "was it scary or not?" The best of the best will have the honor of receiving a Golden Ghost Award.
				</p>

				<p>
					We were so inspired from visiting haunted attractions that in 2017 we decided to do one of our own. After a few trips to Spirit Halloween, Dollar Tree, and other local seasonal Halloween retailers, we had a quick walkthrough for trick or treaters. We had so much fun and received such great feedback from the community that we REALLY got to work to make the second go-round official AF! We learned how to build our own props from raw materials found at The Home Depot and other hardware stores and discovered professional haunted attraction retailers like FrightProps and Dapper Cadaver. Now Haunt Junkies Haunted House features props and effects that would rival any haunted attraction and gets better every year!
				</p>

				<p>
					We are always in need of our next fear fix so if you're a haunt owner who would like for us to come visit, hit us up!
